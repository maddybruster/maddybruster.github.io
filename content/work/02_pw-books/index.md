Series designs for [Phenomenal World Books](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/series/PHWB.html) from the Univeristy of Chicago Press and JFI's Phenomenal World. The series design included a red and a blue line, with a gradation from off-white to off-black in each color generating a potential multiplicity of covers. Photos for each cover were cropped into the Phenomenal World diamond and the titles flow around key parts of the images. Images themselves were selected from open-source archives.

A logo for Phenomenal World Books designed by modifying the existing [Phenomenal World](https://www.phenomenalworld.org) logo. A small bar was added to create the shape of an open book without otherwise adjusting the existing mark. The word "Books" in a heavier weight was added below the existing wordmark to match the weight of the mark. The new PW Books logo was intended to function well horizontally or as a standalone mark on a book's spine. Unused, 2022.
