Series designs for [Phenomenal World Books](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/series/PHWB.html) from the Univeristy of Chicago Press and JFI's Phenomenal World. The series design included a red and a blue line, with a gradation from off-white to off-black in each color generating a potential multiplicity of covers. Photos for each cover were cropped into the Phenomenal World diamond and the titles flow around key parts of the images. Images themselves were selected from open-source archives.
