A logo for Phenomenal World Books designed by modifying the existing [Phenomenal World](https://www.phenomenalworld.org) logo. A small bar was added to create the shape of an open book without otherwise adjusting the existing mark. The word "Books" in a heavier weight was added below the existing wordmark to match the weight of the mark. The new PW Books logo was intended to function well horizontally or as a standalone mark on a book's spine. Unused, 2022.
